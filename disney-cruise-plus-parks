Disney Cruise and Orlando Theme Parks Pack List, 2 Adults and 2 Older Children

For a 10-night trip like this, it helps to do laundry.  Also, on a cruise you
tend to change often, so you can wear most outfits twice before washing them.
We'll each bring 2 beach and 4 non-beach outfits (pack 3, wear 1).

Packing for all of the Orlando theme parks is essentially the same as packing 
for a cruise: warm weather, comfortable clothes, sunscreen, and swimming.  This
list assumes you'll fly in ealy in the morning and head to the cruise or the
parks right away, so we have sunscreen and swimsuits handy.  Apply sunscreen
before boarding the flight, and use the travel sized sunscreen to touch up.

5 nights, 5 days to pack (wear the sixth outfit)

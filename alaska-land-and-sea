Alaska Land and Cruise Tour Pack List, 2 Adults and 2 Older Children

For a 12-night trip like this, it helps to do laundry, but avoid the last 
night of either the land or sea portion, when the laundry room tends to
be a madhouse. Also, on a cruise you tend to change often, so you can 
wear many outfits twice before washing them. We'll wash clothes again 
4 nights into the cruise.

We'll bring outfits for the 5-night land portion, and wash those on the 
second-to-last night on land. Then we'll add formal clothes and swimsuits 
for the cruise, because kids WILL want to swim in the heated pool on deck,
even when it's 60 degrees out.

Packing for Alaska or any northern clime in the summer means packing in
layers and expecting some rain. We're expecting lows in the 30s-50s and
highs in the 50s-70s. It's especially cold on or next to the glaciers.
If you don't have them, I recommend buying light winter gloves, a 
rainproof hat with a brim, a breathable rainproof/windproof jacket, 
shoes with a good tread, and a couple of thermal underlayers. Hello REI.

Another tip:
When the ship departs port, plan to be up on deck (dressed warmly); 
you're likely to see many whales, seabirds, and other wildlife.

5 nights, 5 days to pack (wear the sixth outfit)
